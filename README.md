# Tank Warfare
Tank Warfare is an action-packed single-player shooter game, in which the player takes control of an awesome metal beast and fights against computer-controlled enemy tanks. While moving across the landmine-infested battlefield, the playerâ€™s tank needs to dodge bullets from its opponents while firing its own shells. Once all enemy tanks have been taken down, the player will advance to the next level, facing tougher rivals and harsher environment.
